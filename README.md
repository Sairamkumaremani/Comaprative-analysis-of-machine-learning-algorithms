# Comaprative-analysis-of-machine-learning-algorithms
This Repository is for Mini project which we had done in 3rd Year
We are Comparing the 4 different Machine Learning Algorithms for Same Data Set for the data features Text,label
1) Logisitc Regression
2) Decision Tress 
3) KNN Algorithm
 4)Naive Bayes 
 
Algorithm name                      Accuracy

Logisitc Regression                 94.76% (Approx)

Decision Trees                      89%    (Approx)

KNN Algorithm                       74%    (Approx)
