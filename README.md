# Comaprative-analysis-of-machine-learning-algorithms
This Repository is for Mini project which we had done in 3rd Year(Team Porject)

We are Comparing the 4 different Machine Learning Algorithms in Fake news detection for Same Data Set considering the data features Text,label

The Algorithms which we used are: 

Logisitc Regression

Decision Tress 

KNN Algorithm



 The Accuracy of all Algorithms  are mentioned below:


Logisitc Regression                 94.76% (Approx)

Decision Trees                      89%    (Approx)

KNN Algorithm                       74%    (Approx)
